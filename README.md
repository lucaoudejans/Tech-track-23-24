# 🖥️ Tech track project
For this project I have made a Harry Potter website which displays certain data of seven characters from the movies.
You can scroll through the website and learn lots about the characters. There are a few peculiar things that have been made visual into a data visualisation. See for yourself on my [website](https://tech-track-23-24-taupe.vercel.app/) or download it with the instructions below.
